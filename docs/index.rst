idinn: Inventory-Dynamics Control with Neural Networks
======================================================

`idinn` implements inventory dynamicsâ€“informed neural networks designed for solving both single-sourcing and dual-sourcing problems. Neural network controllers and inventory dynamics are implemented into easily customizable classes, such as :class:`SingleSourcingModel` and :class:`SingleSourcingNeuralController`, to enable users to find the optimal controllers for the user-specified inventory systems.
